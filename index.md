# 🧠 Think ML

Welcome to my **Machine Learning** repository — a curated collection of my code, experiments, and project ideas. This space reflects my hands-on experience and learning journey in machine learning, deep learning, data analysis, and model deployment. It includes both foundational implementations and more advanced applications.
